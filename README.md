VHLoader is used to calculate motion values from bvh files. It saves coordinates in csv files wich can be used for further analysis. It also can show motion animation in openGL as well as printing information about file(hierarchy, motion values, transformation matrices etc...).

VHLoader is using OpenTK library https://github.com/opentk/opentk
