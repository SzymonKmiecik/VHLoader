Project created for the need of the thesis.

VHLoader is used to calculate motion values from bvh files. It saves coordinates in csv files wich can be used for further analysis. It also can show motion animation in openGL as well as printing information about file(hierarchy, motion values, transformation matrices etc...). For now code is quite ugly, for that reason i revrite parsing module into c++.

VHLoader is using OpenTK library https://github.com/opentk/opentk
